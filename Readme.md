# Burnable Token

## Project Description

The Burnable Token is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that implements a custom token with the unique ability to be permanently destroyed (burned) by token holders. This contract allows users to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens from their wallets, reducing the total supply and creating deflationary mechanics.

Unlike traditional tokens where the supply remains constant or only increases, this burnable token gives holders the power to permanently remove tokens from circulation, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens through scarcity.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a deflationary token ecosystem that empowers token holders with the ability to influence tokenomics through burning mechanisms. By allowing users to permanently destroy their tokens, we aim to:

- **Promote Token Scarcity**: Enable holders to reduce total supply, potentially increasing token value
- **Democratic Token Economics**: Give individual holders control over supply dynamics
- **Innovative DeFi Applications**: Provide a foundation for advanced DeFi protocols that utilize burn mechanisms
- **Sustainable Tokenomics**: Create economic models where token burning serves as a value accrual mechanism
